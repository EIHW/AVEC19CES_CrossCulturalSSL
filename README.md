# AVEC19CES - CrossCulturalSSL

This repository contains complementary information to our INTERSPEECH 2020 paper: "An Investigation of Cross-Cultural Semi-Supervised Learning for Continuous Affect Recognition", by Adria Mallol-Ragolta, Nicholas Cummins, and Bj√∂rn Schuller.

Specifically, this contains the subset of samples from both training and development partitions of the AVEC2019CES dataset annotated in terms of valence and arousal through a semi-supervised learning approach. These samples were annotated using a multicultural affect recognition model.
